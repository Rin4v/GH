# Personal project Challenge

A personal project is something that you build for yourself, a project in which you are both the client and the provider. It can be anything: a game, a product idea, a blog, a CMS to showcase your stamp collection... Whatever motivates you _today_.

## Rationale

Why should we motivate learners to work on a personal project ? 3 reasons:

- Motivation: since it is for yourself, it's grounded on **intrinsic motivation**, which is the strongest place in yourself to start building something, a place in which you are your own master.
- Personal projects are a great way to **continue learning** by challenging yourself without being constrained by a customer's (sometimes boring, repetitive) requirements, and to re-invest what you learn every day at BeCode in a project that is close to your heart and what _really_ matters to you. It's a little similar to the red line projects... a project or consolidating learning outcomes.
- **Professional insertion**: any good IT recruiter will prefer an online portfolio from a CV, and a personal project from an online portfolio. So it's a great way for potential employers to "know" you and see what you like doing, the things that keep you working late at night and on week-ends. In a word: your motivation.

## Modus operandi

Say you set yourself the objective that by the end of the week, everyone has found its own personal project and have started working on it.

Here is an (untested) example of how coaches could launch it in their own team.

### Monday:

#### WHAT ?

Let's help them identify a few potential ideas...

1. In teams of 3 to 5, have them identify all hobbies and passions by describing what they use to decorate their bedroom / house, what they do when they are bored or to relax... Each person should identify at least a few Personal Interests.
1. In teams of 2, have them brainstorm each other's "personal interests" on "what could we do with this?". Each notes down what ideas the others came up with. There are no bad ideas.

Another approach would be to have them browse through these online app ideas, full with briefings!

- [Project-Based Learning ideas - DEV Community](https://dev.to/binconsole/curated-list-of-project-based-tutorials-project-based-learning-frontend-3c8l)

#### HOW ?

Let's get them to develop a project briefing out of these great ideas...

1. Have them review a few projects from the two lists of projects, looking more at them from this angle: "how to write a good project briefing"
1. Give them 15 (timeboxed) minutes to write their project briefing. No guideline, let them start from a blank page.
1. Each should pitch their project in focus groups of 4-5 peeps. The others should challenge the project constructively, and give honest feedback on how to improve the briefing: missing information, potential risks...
1. Another 15 minutes to improve.
1. Change the group of 5: Gather feedback. Rince, repeat,
1. Plenary group discussion: what should include a good briefing ? Have them identify the good sections to include. Expect answers like: "target audience (who + their needs), the problem to solve, the envisioned solution, the tech stack, potential KPI..."
1. Have them make a "briefing boilerplate" that everyone can use to describe their project briefing.

And then ? Enough ideation... Let them start !

1. Do advise them to experiment with "**low-fidelity** Rapid prototyping tools" like [Moqups](https://moqups.com) or [Balsamiq Mockup](https://balsamiq.com) (or plain pen and paper) as planning before coding is always useful.

### Tuesday - Friday: work on it, based on the skills acquired

### The following weeks: every Friday could be dedicated to the personal project.

## Examples

- Alexandre Plennevaux's personal Project: [That's The Spirit!](https://thatsthespir.it)

> It started from a love for small, well-written bits of knowledge that I had the habit of noting down on a file on my computer. Sentences from books, sentences taken out of TED talks, clever tweets, youtube videos.. One day, computer crashed. I lost it all. So I figured I should put it somewhere safe, online. This led to that and now, it has evolved into a motivational quotes database.
> Thanks to this, a few years later since I started, I've learned php, fatfree framework, ajax, some advanced css techniques, sass, gulp, webpack, how to build a REST API, PWA and now am rebuilding it in React. But I also learned growth hacking, SEO, design and usability.
> I did not earn one EUR out of this project. But I earned tens of thousand of EUR with the things I learned thanks to it.
> So my advise to you is: start dreaming and build something for yourself. Start now. There are no bad ideas. Just get doing !
